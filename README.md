# Mid-Conversation Phone Access
Mod for "Date Everything!" game that lets you reload or view character info during conversaions/dialogue

Allows limited access to phone during conversations/dialogue for when you want to reload your game mid-conversation or quickly check the Date-A-Dex when someone mentions a character you can't quite remember!

Enabled apps during conversations:
* Settings
* Save/Load (but only Load is available, Save screen is disabled because game can't handle saving/loading mid-coversation state as of right now)
* Main menu
* Roomers
* Date-A-Dex
* S.P.E.C.S.

Disabled apps during conversations:
* thiscord (disabled to prevent potential conflicts with multiple conversations)
* wrkspce (same reason as above)
* all of the character-interaction apps and using Dateviators on the phone (those do not work mid-conversation anyway)
